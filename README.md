# Featured Professor Plugin

This allows an admin to add a Featured Professor into a post or page. There is a preset layout associated with the professor as well.

## Design
The plug uses a custom post type, professors, and custom fields for that professor. It creates a Gutenberg Block Type that gives a dropdown menu of all the Professors to choose from. This plugin can be placed multiple times on a page or post and will link to the Professor detail page.

## Language Translation
This plugin also supports wp.i18n.__ language translation.  I have used the Loco Translate plugin and it works perfectly.
